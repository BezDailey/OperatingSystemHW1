# Assignment Summary for Operatinf Systems Homework 1

## Introduction

This assignment serves as an introduction to a range of tools essential for submitting, building, and debugging code. Students will set up a Virtual Machine (VM) on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), learn about and use different software tools, and complete two coding tasks. The main goal is to help students get up to speed with the development environment and essential tools for the course.

## Content Overview

- **Setup**: Steps to set up a VM on GCP.
- **Useful Tools**: Introduction to git, make, gdb, tmux, vim, and ctags.
- **Your First Assignment**: Programming tasks related to `make`, `wc`, executables, and memory addresses.
- **Bonus Tasks**: Advanced programming with `wc` and `map`.
  
## etup

- Create a Google account with your `@morehouse.edu` email.
- Register for the Google Cloud Platform Education Grant for Students.
- Set up a VM on GCP with specific configurations (Ubuntu 18.04, 40GB disk, etc.).
- Install necessary tools via terminal (`gcc`, `gdb`, `tmux`, `make`, `git`).

## Useful Tools

- **Git**: Basics of version control with Git and GitHub.
- **Make**: Introduction to the `make` utility for automatic building.
- **GDB**: How to use the GNU Debugger (`gdb`) for debugging C programs.
- **Tmux**: Introduction to terminal multiplexing with `tmux`.
- **Vim**: Basic text editing in the terminal using Vim.
- **Ctags**: Navigation through large codebases using `ctags`.

## Your First Assignment

- **Make**: Write a Makefile that compiles `main.c`, `wc.c`, and `map.c`.
- **wc**: Implement a simplified version of the `wc` utility in C.
- **Executables and Addresses**: Explore aspects of running programs using `gdb` and `objdump`.

### Bonus Tasks

- **wc**: Enhancements to the `wc` implementation.
- **Map**: Write a program (`map.c`) to reveal the structure of a running C program.

## Questions

Several questions are provided for each section. Answers should be documented in text files (`gdb.txt`, `objdump.txt`, `map.txt`).
